# **Sales Forecasting Project**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on forecasting sales using historical sales data. It encompasses various stages of a data science pipeline including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## **Repository Contents**

- **Data:** The `SuperStoreSalesDataSet.xlsx` file contains the historical sales data that is used for analysis and modeling.

- **Notebooks:** The `sales_forecasting.ipynb` Jupyter notebook includes Python code for data preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

- **Models:** This directory houses the saved trained models, which include linear regression and Prophet models.

- **Figures:** This directory contains figures generated during the analysis. These figures include visualizations of sales data and model predictions.

- **README:** This file provides an overview of the project, its contents, and instructions for running the code.

## **Requirements**
The project requires the following software and libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Prophet
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## **Usage**

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required dependencies using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Open the Notebook:** Open the `sales_forecasting.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.

4. **Run the Code:** Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

5. **Review the Results:** Review the generated figures and evaluation metrics to assess model performance.

6. **Deployment (Optional):** If desired, deploy the trained model for making real-time sales forecasts.
