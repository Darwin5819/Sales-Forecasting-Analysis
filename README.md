Sales Forecasting Project
Overview
This repository contains code and analysis for sales forecasting using historical sales data. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training using linear regression and Prophet, evaluation metrics, and visualization of results.

Contents
Data: The SuperStoreSalesDataSet.xlsx file contains the historical sales data used for analysis and modeling.
Notebooks: The sales_forecasting.ipynb Jupyter notebook contains the Python code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
Models: This directory contains saved trained models, including linear regression and Prophet models.
Figures: Contains figures generated during the analysis, including visualizations of sales data and model predictions.
README: This file provides an overview of the project, its contents, and instructions for running the code.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
pandas
scikit-learn
Prophet
matplotlib
seaborn
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Open the sales_forecasting.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
Review the generated figures and evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
Optionally, deploy the trained model for making real-time sales forecasts.
